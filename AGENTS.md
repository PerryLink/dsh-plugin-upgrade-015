# AGENTS.md

> 🪦 **RETIRED 2026-10-05 (maintainer ruling) — do not develop here.** This repository is frozen: no further releases, fixes, or security updates. **All plugin-upgrade work continues exclusively in `dsh-plugin-upgrade`**, which routes a repository by the version that repository pins for itself (`engines.dsh` / peer ranges / devDeps). Treat everything below as historical documentation of the `dsh-plugin-upgrade-015` corridor. The rules in this file are NOT in force for new work — follow `dsh-plugin-upgrade`'s `AGENTS.md`.

Standalone DeepSeek Harness plugin repository (`dsh-plugin-upgrade-015`). Development
follows the dsh-plugin-guide skill and the official plugin contract; this file records
repo-local decisions. Read `README.md` (external contract) and the packaged merged corridor
card (`skills/plugin-upgrade-015/references/v0.1.3-alpha.1-to-v0.1.5-rc.1.md`) before changing
behavior.

## A corridor never widens (and one package may carry several closed corridors)

- **A corridor never widens.** This package upgrades plugins across `0.1.3-alpha.1 →
  0.1.5-rc.1` and nothing else. Do not widen the peer band or the card to "all versions":
  a drifting card is worse than no card. A hop that adds a seam is a new package.
- **One package may carry several *closed* corridors.** That is what this repository is: one
  npm package holding leg A (`0.1.3-alpha.1 → 0.1.5-alpha.1`) and leg B (`0.1.5-alpha.1 →
  0.1.5-rc.1`) as **two closed corridors of one span**, each keeping its own evidence, card
  section, fixtures and rollback path. Neither leg may absorb a third hop.
- **This supersedes the family's earlier rule.** The retired `dsh-plugin-upgrade` and
  `dsh-plugin-upgrade-rc1` each carried a "**The corridor is locked** … a new corridor is a
  new package" section plus "**zero code dependency on the sibling corridor**: no `import`,
  no vendoring, no shared `SEAMS`". The owner deliberately superseded the second half of that
  pair: the merged package **does** share one `SEAMS` (one scanner, one catalog, one
  id-parity gate) because the two legs are contiguous hops of one span. What survives
  unchanged is the numbering discipline — a corridor is *closed*, not open-ended — and the
  per-leg ownership below.

Consequences accepted by this repository:

- The merged catalog (20 seams: `S3`, `S8`, `S9`, `M1`, `S4`, `S5`, `S6`, `S7`, `S2`, `S1`,
  `S10`, `C1`, `C2`, `P1`, `C4`, `C5`, `H1`, `H2`, `H4`, `H3`) is evidence-bound to the two
  tag ranges it was measured on — leg A `dsh-v0.1.5-alpha.1` (2026-09-09 wave over 40 plugin
  repos) and leg B `dsh-v0.1.5-alpha.1..dsh-v0.1.5-rc.1` (2026-09-10). A hop after
  `0.1.5-rc.1` (rc.2, the final release, anything later) is a **new package**, not a wider
  card. The harness hop `0.1.5-rc.1 → 0.1.5-rc.2` added no plugin-facing seam, which is why
  the span ends at rc.1 while the dev/test pin and the CI probe run on `0.1.5-rc.2`.
- **Leg A owns the session-format seams** (`assistant/message.stream`, `S3`;
  `SessionHandleReadResult`, `S8`; `EpochHeader.system`, `S2`; `ctx.agent`, `S5`; `Inbox`,
  `S6`; `SystemPrompt.persona`, `S9`; the V3 log generation, `S1`) and **leg B does not
  restate them** — measured: the whole `packages/core/session/src` diff inside leg B's range
  is two added event-type literals and one comment line. Each leg's card section keeps its own
  scope statement; restating across legs is drift.
- **`C3` is retired.** Leg B's card spelled the stale-type-line false green `C3`; it is the
  same defect as leg A's `M1` and is folded into it, so `M1` carries both causes (an
  unresolvable `tsconfig` `paths` alias and dev/test types pinned at `0.1.5-alpha.*`). The
  card records the old spelling in the fold notes, but `C3` is not a seam id: `--seams C3`
  matches nothing and `types.d.ts` does not accept it.
- The peer band is **unchanged** by both legs. `>=0.1.2-rc.1 <0.2.0` alone rejects
  `0.1.5-rc.1` under npm semver's prerelease-tuple rule (measured `false` on semver 7.8.5);
  the `|| >=0.1.5-alpha.1 <0.2.0` segment is what admits it. `P1` forbids dropping it, and
  this package's own `peerDependencies` keeps both segments.
- The `C1` ruling (the bare `conversation` slot removal is a **public extension-point
  break**, kept at `error`, with a rewrite recipe and a real-browser exit criterion) is
  recorded in card §2 §3.3. Do not downgrade it to an advisory without new upstream
  evidence (an alias, a shim, or an official migration note).

## Hard rules applied here

- **`C1` is an error, never a warning.** The deletion has no alias and the injection callback
  never runs, so the only honest level is error. Only promote `C4`/`C5`/`H1`/`H2`/`H4` from
  advisory to error with evidence and a fixture that proves the false positive is gone.
- **`M1` and `P1` are blockers, never warnings.** If the local type line is stale (either
  cause), or the peer band lost its second segment, every other local signal is fake. `M1`
  and `P1` are **structured** checks, so their catalog `test` is `null` without being
  card-only.
- **The leg-A error seams stay errors.** `S3`, `S8`, `S9`, `S4`, `S5` and `S6` each make a
  repo that looks green fail on the target host; only demote one with new upstream evidence.
- **Advisory seams stay advisory.** `S7`/`S2`/`S1`/`S10` and `C4`/`C5`/`H1`/`H2`/`H4` have
  legitimate matches; they are leads for manual review. Only promote one to `error` with
  evidence and a fixture that proves the false positive is gone.
- **`H3` is card-only.** It is documented, id-parity checked, and deliberately has no
  detector; `CARD_ONLY` is exactly `['H3']` and the test suite asserts it stays that way.
- **The scanner is read-only and dependency-free.** No network, no child process, no write
  inside `--repo`; `lib/scan.mjs` imports only `node:fs` and `node:path`. Keep it that way.
- **A clean scan is necessary, not sufficient.** Never describe a scan as proof of
  adaptation: this span's breakage is silent from both ends, so a session-log writer needs a
  resume round-trip (`S3`), a client half needs a real browser assertion, and the card's exit
  criterion is a real-host smoke on a temp `DSH_HOME`.
- **The card and the catalog are one catalog.** `test/card.test.mjs` fails when their ids or
  severities disagree, and when the card mints an id outside the merged 20. Change the card
  first, then the catalog, in the same commit.
- **Mount loud.** A missing `SKILL.md`, an empty body, or a frontmatter without `name` must
  abort the mount. Never register a placeholder skill.
- **The skill id is the frontmatter name.** `skillName` selects the directory; the registered
  name comes from the file. Keep the four in sync (`plugin-upgrade-015`: directory,
  frontmatter `name`, `package.json` Config default, `cordis.patch.yml`).
- **Registration is an effect.** `ctx.skills.register()` runs inside `ctx.effect()` so the
  disposer removes the contribution on unload; the test asserts that.
- **No build step.** Pure ESM: `index.mjs` + `lib/` are the shipped artifacts. There is no
  `build`/`prepare` script — keep it that way.
- **Optional seams fail closed.** `skills` is a hard `inject`; if the service is absent the
  plugin waits rather than registering into a void.
- **License headers.** `// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0` is the first line of every
  source file; `# SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0` heads `cordis.patch.yml`.

## Checks

```sh
npm install                        # or: pnpm install (pnpm-lock.yaml is committed)
npm test                           # node --test: scanner (both legs) + card parity + real-registry mount
npm run verify:self-contained      # every import resolves inside the package
npm run verify:artifacts           # tarball contents + entry import + dev-only content excluded
npm run check:readmes              # five-language README consistency
npm pack                           # the published tarball
```

`pnpm-workspace.yaml` keeps `minimumReleaseAge: 0`: pnpm 11 enables a 1440-minute age gate by
default and its frozen-install lockfile verification ignores `minimumReleaseAgeExclude`, so
the freshly published `@deepseek-ai` pins would otherwise keep a fresh install red for 24h
after every harness release.

## Release

Version is currently `0.1.0`. The npm name `dsh-plugin-upgrade-015` is brand new, so
this package starts its own version line at `0.1.0`; the two retired packages' histories live
in `CHANGELOG.md` under `[Unreleased]` and below. For a new version: bump
`package.json#version`, stamp the CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]` section into `## [<x.y.z>] - <UTC
date>`, re-run the full gate, commit `chore(release): <x.y.z>`, and `git tag -a v<x.y.z>`.
`git push origin main --follow-tags` triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which re-runs
the gate, publishes to npm with provenance (skipped without the `NPM_TOKEN` secret) and
creates the GitHub Release from the stamped CHANGELOG section behind an idempotent
`gh release view` guard. Never push a tag for a version already on the registry.
**Publish incident (2026-09-10, the first tag of the retired `dsh-plugin-upgrade-rc1`).**
`v0.1.0`'s first run failed in `Publish to npm` with `*** is not a legal HTTP header value`,
after the provenance statement had already been signed and published to the transparency log.
The step read the token through setup-node's `${NODE_AUTH_TOKEN}` expansion at the time; it
now normalises line breaks and writes `//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=…` into
`NPM_CONFIG_USERCONFIG` itself. The rewritten step reports whether the secret carried line
breaks, and it reported **no** — so the trailing-newline hypothesis is disproven and the
mechanism of the env-expanded failure is NOT established. What is established: that path
failed, the directly written userconfig publishes. `v0.1.0` was re-tagged onto the fix
(allowed: the version was not on the registry yet). The rewritten step is inherited by this
package unchanged; do not reintroduce `${NODE_AUTH_TOKEN}` without re-testing it.

The scanner catalog is evidence-bound: a version bump that changes a seam must update the
card, `docs/EVIDENCE.md`, the fixtures **of the leg it belongs to** and `CHANGELOG.md` in the
same commit.

**Post-publish integration (not done in this repository's history yet).** The README badge
row expects `PerryLink/dsh-plugin-doctor` to carry a
`PerryLink__dsh-plugin-upgrade-015.svg` badge, and the family also enrols each package
in the Gitee mirror, the `dsh-catalog` directory and the omdsh workshop list. Those are
release-side steps performed from the family workspace after the first tag. The two retired
package names stay on the registry (unpublished content is not removed by publishing a new
name); their README/card wording is now historical.

## Docs

- Five-language READMEs (`README.md` is the source; `README-zh.md`, `README-es.md`,
  `README-pt.md`, `README-hi.md` follow). Every behavior change updates all five in the same
  commit; `check:readmes` enforces the shared section count and the install line in CI.
- GitHub topics `dsh`, `dsh-plugin`, `deepseek-harness`, `deepseek`, `cordis`,
  `plugin-upgrade`, `migration`, `skill`, `version-card`, `scanner`, `client-slots` (mirror
  `package.json` keywords; the ecosystem's visibility channel is the `dsh-plugin` topic).
- License is Apache-2.0 (`LICENSE` + the package.json `license` field).
  `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` documents install-time dependencies; nothing is bundled.
- Every factual claim in the card or the scanner traces to a command recorded in
  `docs/EVIDENCE.md` — §A for leg A's provenance (via the retired `dsh-plugin-upgrade` card,
  now merged in as Leg A) and §1–§10 for leg B's records. Where a claim could not be verified
  it is marked **unverified** and kept out of the card.
